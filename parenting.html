      <h6><cite>By Megan Doll</cite></h6>
      <br>
      <p class="lead">Before I had my son Rafael, a friend of mine—a smart, understatedly chic woman who has been a sort of a bookish big sister to me—remarked how, contrary to her fears, she found motherhood intellectually stimulating. I filed this comment away in the
        back of my brain. I, too, had long harbored concerns about boredom and motherhood.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>For me, the pleasures of adulthood have always related to being able to make my world bigger; through reading, studying, interacting, and traveling, I am forever trying to broaden my frame of reference. I was worried that a baby would shrink
        that world. (In fact, I caught myself literally navel-gazing at times as my pregnancy advanced.)</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>There is, without a doubt, a reorientation of interests and priorities that happens when a child enters your life. I am way more entertained by nonsense babble-conversations than I ever dreamed possible; I find my baby’s attempts at crawling
        a more riveting display of physical prowess than any televised sport. As someone who hates shopping, I am stunned by how fun it is to look at baby clothes. But even with those new developments, I don’t feel as though I’m mired in minutiae.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>Being with Rafael has been an education. A newborn is such a raw organism—unprogrammed and uninhibited by societal expectation. His feelings are completely unmediated. Lacking a sense of “self,” he is truly unselfconscious.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>As adults, we often disconnect from the embodied nature of our emotions. Our thoughts and feelings don’t just live in our heads, they live in our physical bodies as well. (<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/01/11/what-is-an-emotion-william-james/"> "What Is An Emotion" by William James</a>)
        That’s why they’re called feelings. </p>

      <p class="lead"><br>When Rafael experiences pain or discomfort, there is no daylight between that feeling and his full-throated, whole-body expression of it. As I would idiosyncratically put it: “he cries with his whole baby.”</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>He doesn’t try to stifle the feeling, or deny or disallow it, or any of those sophisticated things we do as adults. He lets it run its course and welcomes what comfort I can offer him.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>When other people are with Rafael, I’ve sometimes found myself (unnecessarily) apologizing when he’s upset—especially when he’s inconsolable. “He’s not bad,” I’d say, somewhat defensively. “He’s just uncomfortable.”</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>It’s made me reconsider “bad” or difficult behavior more broadly. Perhaps many of our adult forms of acting out are also crude expressions of an underlying discomfort. Maybe our some of our worst behavior comes from an unease we haven’t worked
        through or even identified.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>In following this line of thinking, I notice how much more empathy I have for children than adults. In part, I suppose, because adults have more resources for dealing with their discomfort, but also because they are usually more successful at
        making excuses for their behavior when they act out. (We tend not to want to deal with difficult people, so we pretend to accept their rationalizations and hope they’ll leave us alone. Or at least, I do.)</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>Children are born yogis. They come into this world with no sense of discrete individuality. Our persona—literally, our “mask”—is something we construct over time through the choices we make: what we do, who we associate with, the objects we
        surround ourselves with, and so on. Through our masks, we distinguish ourselves from one another.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>It’s a normal part of a person’s development, but it also comes at a cost. According to yoga, the source of much of our suffering comes from our illusion of separateness. In defining ourselves, we also hold ourselves apart. </p>

      <cite><br><i>Ah, not to be cut off,<br>
    not through the slightest partition<br>
    shut out from the law of the stars.<br>
    The inner—what is it?<br>
    if not intensified sky,<br>
    hurled through with birds and deep<br>
    with the winds of homecoming.</i></p>
  </cite class="lead">--Rainer Maria Rilke</p>

          <p class="lead"><br>At 6 months, Rafael is just beginning to realize that we’re different people. (Although, I’ve felt like a fused person myself for the past year and a half.) His first encounter with separation anxiety came earlier this month when he started his
            part-time daycare. His first week was tough, and I found myself worrying about him (and his caretakers) most of the time. </p>

          <p class="lead"><br>The difficulty of the transition was surprising to me, because I had been so accustomed to seeing him take new experiences in stride. When we’re together he’s unstoppable: he rides airplanes, pets dogs, and conquers water parks. He’s a cheerful
            little trooper on my most boring of errands, and has handled long lines at the post office with more patience and maturity than me. It is a joy to nurture and behold his adventurous spirit. So I was at a loss when my friendly, happy little guy
            became disconsolate the moment I turned my back to leave.</p>

          <p class="lead"><br>Here again, I found myself thinking about how his formative experiences foreshadow the bigger themes that emerge in our adult lives. I think that separation anxiety is something we continue to experience into adulthood, we just conceive of it differently.
          </p>

          <p class="lead"><br>Our sense of separateness makes us miserable: it pits us against our neighbors and fosters painful, often needless competition. It leads us to the mindset that life is a zero-sum game and that one person’s success is our loss. Separateness fuels
            our envy, feeds our greed, and stokes our judgment. </p>

          <p class="lead"><br>It also holds us back. Just as my presence gives Rafael courage, feeling alone can make us small. For some, the coping mechanism of choice will be to play it safe because it’s scary to be out there, alone and adrift in the world. </p>

          <p class="lead"><br>We almost all organize our lives around building up and protecting our “self.” In yoga, we work to unlearn this sense of separation and remember our hidden wholeness.</p>

        <p class="lead"><br>Before having Rafael, I was skeptical when people would talk about how much you can learn from kids. I see now that the wisdom of children is their ignorance of culture.</p>
