    <p class="lead">I am not a yogi.</p>

<p class="lead">I’ve practiced yoga for 19 years, which sounds like I should be the most flexible, toned and serene person you’ve ever met. The truth is I can barely touch my toes with straight legs. So, it’s easy to say I’m not a yogi, but somehow yoga stretches to all aspects of my life.</p>

<p class="lead">I believe after practicing for 19 years, with some obvious breaks, yoga is at the core of all I do. From giving advice to friends and family, to being honest with those around me, always trying to create balance and live in the moment, and placing my family as the top priority. </p>

<p class="lead">Taking care of my family means providing a sanctuary for them to come home to. Our daily lives are so hectic that we need a calming safe place to begin and end our days. Your home can either nurture you and create calm or depletes your energy and leaves you exhausted. </p>

<p class="lead">There are a few simple things you can start with to create a more nurturing and happy environment:</p>

<p class="lead">1.	Clutter – This causes physical and emotional chaos. Spend 10 minutes a day on each of your out of control areas in your home, whether that is a pile up of junk mail on the dining room table, or a closet busting at the seams. Ten minutes doesn’t seem like much but it can make a big dent if you do it daily, and is better than inaction.</p>
<p class="lead">2.	Only things you love – Flipping through magazines and browsing Pinterest are fun, but don’t get pulled in to buying accessories and items because it looks good in a picture. I question everything I buy, maybe too much, but I only want to spend my money on things that I really love and make me happy every time I look at them. Usually, these are things that I find on trips that can remind me of what a wonderful time we had, or a beautiful piece of art that triggers a good memory. </p>
I’ve cleared out most items that have negative attachments to them. Clearing or not buying this type of clutter keeps live simplified. You appreciate what you have, and aren’t always yearning for more more more. </p>
<p class="lead">3.	Color – There have been many studies on color and how it effects our moods. Begin to take notice how certain colors make you feel. Maybe you don’t paint your walls all those colors because that can create visual chaos, but bring it in through art, books, pillows, and blankets, even glasses sitting on a shelf that are a pretty green can bring in just the right amount of color. https://www.colorpsychology.org/
Seventy-five percent of my home is a light greenish-gray. This might sound boring, but when you layer on artwork, furniture and accessories that provoke conversation it has created an environment that my friends and family feel very comfortable in.</p>
<p class="lead">4.	Nature – bring in natural elements. Wood bowls and plants are the easiest things to start with. As humans, we are naturally drawn to natural beauty. Even removing window coverings so you have an unobstructed view of the outside can help give you a sigh of relief. </p>
<p class="lead">5.	Budgets – One must be honest with one’s self about what is within their means. Nothing is worse than spending beyond your means. You are working hard to pay for STUFF, and I believe this starts a vicious cycle of wanting to buy more stuff, which creates clutter. Buy the best you can afford, but nothing that would take you more than six months to pay off when it comes to furniture and décor. It’s better to save the money for an item then to purchase something of lesser quality just so you can have it right now, or worse to buy something so outrageously expensive that it takes years to pay off. Creating debt to have a beautiful home just creates more pressure and chaos and doesn’t allow us to breath. </p>
I shop second hand for a lot of items like tables, dining chairs, art, accessories or things that have such classic lines that they are worth reupholstering. Things I buy new are typically mattresses and sofas. My favorite is chairish.com or ebth.com, they’re addicting, you’ve been warned.</p>
I believe this is also another reason friends and family feel comfortable in our home. I’m not worried that something is going to get ruined because I’m still paying for it or it was so expensive I could never replace it. </p>
<p class="lead">6.	No room off limits – I never want a formal living room and dining room. I want every part of our home to be welcoming to little kids and adults. Don’t get me wrong, I have fragile things, but I assume kids have been taught to be respectful of other people’s things, I’ve yet to have a problem. I think this approach makes people feel at ease and know that they can speak with me in an honest and open way.</p>
<p class="lead">7.	Mix periods – Another way to create a welcoming and relaxed environment is to mix period styles of furniture and accessories. This does two things, it creates a less formal environment, and makes your space unique to you which shows your personality to all that enter your home. </p>

<p class="lead">I’m sure there are a lot of ways one can live a yogi lifestyle, but the items I’ve listed help me live a simple and more honest life style to create peace off the mat.  </p>
