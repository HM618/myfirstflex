            <h1 class="header">It Begins with Breath</h1>
      <h6><i>By Greg Gumucio</i></h6>
      <br>
      <p class="lead"><br><i>From our first gasp to our last sigh, our breath fills every moment of our lives. So why don’t we take it more seriously?</i></p>

      <p class="lead"><br>The importance of breath seems so obvious, and yet we still haven’t grasped its value in our daily life and well-being. On the surface, people understand that breath is vitally important, but we don’t seem to live our lives with any real depth of
        understanding of this fact.</p>
      <p class="lead"><br>Consider this: More and more of us are paying extraordinary attention to what we eat, spending a large share of our paychecks on organic, healthy food, as evidenced by Whole Foods’ best-ever sales of <a hrf="http://s21.q4cdn.com/118642233/files/doc_news/financial_press_releases/2017/Whole-Foods-Market-Reports-Third-Quarter-2017-Results-FINAL.pdf"> $3.7 billion last quarter</a>. Yet
        we can go upwards of 3 weeks without food. We’ve also become far more conscious of the quality and quantity of water we drink -- so much so that <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/bottled-water-statistics/">Americans spent $11.8 billion</a> on
        designer water in 2016 alone. Hello! Designer water is costing more than the gasoline we put in our cars. And we can survive without water for a week or so.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>We can only go approximately <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/inside-the-mind/human-brain/brain-death1.htm">6-7 minutes without oxygen before the brain dies</a>, so wouldn’t it stand to reason that breathing should command even more attention
        than what we eat and drink? You’d think so. But for the masses, our breath is taken for granted until it’s threatened in some way. It’s not uncommon to hear conversations about the latest health food (bone broth! ghee!) or even how important drinking
        water is to our overall health<br> (Gotta stay hydrated! 8-10 glasses/day!). </p>

      <p class="lead"><br>Our existence, our life depends on our ability to breathe, and yet when was the last time (or the first time) you had a conversation about your breath and breathing? For most, being told to “take a deep breath” is often the extent of it.</p>
      <h4 class="lead"><br>Science gets on board with the importance of breathing.</h4>
      <p class="lead"><br>Yogis have known it for centuries, but now the benefits of breathing with awareness and intention are being scientifically proven. Researchers at the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/">Stanford University School of Medicine</a> recently concluded a
        study that shows how slow breathing induces tranquility. The study is hopeful that a better understanding of how we breathe and the quality and awareness of our breath will lead to therapies for stress, depression and other negative emotions.
        This is just one of myriad studies that have scientifically proven the benefits of breath.</p>
      <p class="lead"><br>Now, how about a proper dose of common sense?</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>Pause, pay attention and we realize it’s been there all along.</h4>
      <p class="lead"><br>Scientific evidence is great, but for those of us who want to rely on our own experience, intuition and understanding, we need only pause and pay attention. Our emotions are linked to our breath. When we’re angry, our breathing can be very sharp
        and short. When we cry, our breathing takes on a unique pattern that’s very different from the pattern that occurs when we are laughing. Intimacy has yet a different rhythm; in some Tantra teachings, infusing intimacy with a coupled breathing
        can lead to a more intense experience physically and emotionally.</p>
      <p class="lead"><br>Now the good news is, we can learn to manage our breathing to change our states of being emotionally and physically. The bad news is that most of what we’ve been taught about how to breathe is wrong. But don’t worry, it’s easy to learn a better
        way to breathe. And it will profoundly improve your well-being.</p>
      <p class="lead"><br>Both Merriam-Webster and Urban Dictionary define “mouth breather” in very unflattering terms.</p>
      <p class="lead"> Merriam-Webster Dictionary: mouth-breather</p>
      <p class="lead"><i>Noun; informal</i></p>
      <p class="lead">1. a stupid person.</p>

      <p class="lead">Urban Dictionary: mouthbreather</p>
      <p class="lead">1. literally, someone who lacks enough intelligence that they never learned to breathe through their nose.</p>
      <p class="lead">2. a really dumb person.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>Mouth breathers, however, aren’t stupid at all. Sadly, they’re often suffering… from asthma, allergies, snoring, sleep disorders, poor concentration, lethargy, high blood pressure, anxiety, poor dental health and more. They spend fortunes and lifetimes
        on medication and apparatus to correct what learning to breathe correctly – through the nose, softly and slowly – will naturally do.</p>
      <h4 class="lead"><br>The myth of deep breathing</h4>
      <p class="lead"><br>We’ve all been taught that deep breathing is good because it theoretically delivers more oxygen to our bodies. Fitness instructors, physiotherapists, stress counselors, psychologists… all teach deep breathing. Surely they haven’t all gotten it wrong! But
        think about how people breathe when stressed or angry: Mouth open with large, noisy, repetitive gasps for air.</p>
    <p class="lead"><br>How, then, can it make sense to bring the body to a state of relaxation using more large breaths with the mouth open?</p>
      <p class="lead"><br>It seems logical that the oxygen we inhale is good, so we should breathe in more of it, and the carbon dioxide we exhale is bad.But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_effect">Bohr effect</a> explains that the ratio of carbon dioxide
        to oxygen permits the release or retention of oxygen from the blood. Oxygen is transported in blood by hemoglobin cells. Without an adequate presence of carbon dioxide, oxygen remains bound to the hemoglobin cells and cannot be released. This
        leads to oxygen deficiency in the tissues of the brain, heart, kidneys and other organs, and to the raising of blood pressure.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>Therefore, oxygen deficiency is not caused by lack of oxygen,but by lack of carbon dioxide. Simply put, if we breathe too much, we get less oxygen.</p>

      <p class="lead"><br>A fun fact: The air we breathe contains 200 times less carbon dioxide than we need and 10 times more oxygen than we need. So the function of our respiratory system is not just to draw in air and push it out; it is to maintain a very specific ratio
        of oxygen to carbon dioxide so our blood can actually utilize the oxygen we breathe.</p>

      <h4 class="lead"><br>Shut your mouth and change your life.</h4>
      <p class="lead"><br><a href="http://buteykoclinic.com/">The Buteyko Method</a> is a breathing technique named after its founder, Dr. Konstantin Buteyko, that teaches how to breathe correctly to maintain the correct ratio of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the bloodstream. It’s
        series of simple breathing techniques that can be easily incorporated into the daily life of any adult or child. You don’t have to perform any sophisticated postures or poses. You can use the method at any time and in any situation.</p>

    <p class="lead"><br>The success of the Buteyko method in the treatment of asthma, sleep disorders and other illnesses is proven by <a href="http://buteykoclinic.com/buteyko-trials/">clinical trials</a> and <a href="http://www.buteyko.com/research/trials/index_trials.html">hard scientific data dating back to 1994.</a></p>
      <p class="lead"><br>The Buteyko Method, at a basic level, involves:</p>
      <ul style=“discs”>
        <li class="lead"> Switching from mouth breathing to nasal breathing</li>
        <li class="lead"> Relaxation of the diaphragm and creating a mild air shortage</li>
        <li class="lead"> Learning how to unblock the nose using breath hold exercises</li>

        <h4 class="lead"><br>Where to start?</h4>
        <p class="lead"><br>If you’re feeling overwhelmed by all the deep breaths you’ve taken in vain throughout your life, rest assured that you’re on your way to a new way of breathing that will calm any anxiety. Start with the <a href="http://buteykoclinic.com/the-buteyko-method/">Control Pause test</a>.
          It’s a simple test that helps determine the level of carbon dioxide in your blood.</p>

        <p class="lead"><br>In part 2 of this topic, I’ll get into the breathing exercises, which vastly improved my quality of sleep and energy after practicing them for just a week.</p>
      <h4 class="lead"><br>You get what you pay for.</h4>
<p class="lead"><br>With common sense, science and our health as good reasons to get on board with breathing correctly, why haven’t we? Well,when things are amiss, you can usually follow the money to the
real story.</p>
 
<p class="lead"><br>I wish there was a prettier way to paint this picture. There isn’t. What do Ariana Grande, Jennifer Aniston, Rhianna and 50 Cent have in common? They’re just a few of the celebrity endorsers of designer water. Who endorses breathing? No one. Breathing isn’t sexy or exciting. Breathing is boring. I am personally convinced that once someone (some corporation) finds a sexy way to package it, promote it and sell it, there will be an explosion of interest and sales. Laugh? Oxygen is for sale at trendy oxygen bars and in compressed air cans you’ll find at Wal-Mart in mountain towns. Someday maybe people will see the absurdity of paying for oxygen that’s already 10 times more abundant in our atmosphere than what we can utilize. Maybe they’ll joke, “He’s such a good salesman, he could sell oxygen to people on Earth.”</p> 
 
<p class="lead"><br>And pharmaceutical companies have billions of dollars invested in so-called remedies for the illnesses that proper breathing can alleviate. But they’re not the only ones to blame. In today’s instant-gratification society, many would rather continue the medicated march than try a new path that requires new skills.</p>
 
<p class="lead"><br>Finally, it’s difficult for some to understand and embrace this new way of thinking about breathing – let alone to try it. It doesn’t fit western medicine norms. Too often I’m met with incredulous disbelief. It can’t possibly be that easy. Too good to be true. Sounds like new-age hippy stuff to me.</p>
 
<p class="lead"><br>In the words of Mark Twain, it’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they’ve been fooled.</p>
