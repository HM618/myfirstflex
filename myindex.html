          <h1 class="header">Finding love and happiness in the chaos.</h1>
          <br>
          <p class="lead">My name is Haven. I am my husband's girlfriend of ten years and a mother of three (plus a pup!). I am also a fulltime partner in my husband's businesses, and have recently taken up coding to contribute to our company's needs.</p>

          <p class="lead">My life is full. It is productive. It is loving, and it can be chaotic. More and more studies are being brought to the public's attention about what "stress" is and it's effects on health and quality of life. Yet despite the enormity of strain
            that common culture seems to feel each day, I firmly believe that one “can have it all”, including happiness.</p>

          <p class="lead">Having it all in life isn't like having all of the shoes, or having all of the Daniel Steele novels. You do not acquire a husband and then he stays. You do not earn a salary or commission simply by showing up to work. </p>

          <p class="lead">"Having it all" means giving love and attention where it is needed, to constantly set, maintain, and then reorganize boundaries according to the world around you. It requires balance.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="lead">When I first conceived of writing this blog a close family member had just laughed at me when I expressed feeling overwhelmed. I remember her clear, sincere gaze as she asked, "How can you be stressed when you're a yogi?".<br>
            <BR> Many feelings and thoughts arose, including the desire to slap her. I <i>do</i> yoga regularly, but that doesn't mean my life is peachy all of the time!<br> The offense had triggered such an irritation in me that I became curious. Why was
            I so bothered? She had not meant it in any cruel or crude way. She was simply stating what she thought was true.<br>
            <br>If I dedicated an hour of each day to moving and breathing on my mat shouldn't that soothe any circumstantial pressure?<br>
            <br>With a bit more observation I realized that I was treating my yoga practice as a temporary break from the world, when really what I understood the point of asana to be is to ready the body to engage <i>with</i> the world- fully. What I
            had been learning while trying to breath freely in a balancing posture, or learning to move with my eyes closed was that <i> movement is inherent in the <b> balance</b></i>. That being steady did not mean becoming like a stone, but rather
            a supple being capable of breathing completely without losing stability.</p>

          <p class="lead">And that is the goal of this blog. The yogi is painted as a being "in balance" and "in union" with the world. The articles you'll find here are written by people whom I respect and feel exemplify aspects of a "yogi's" life that anyone can draw
            from. They are everyday men and women who are smart, creative and accomplished, and whom I've enjoyed learning from throughout the years. </p>

          <p class="lead">So, to get this understanding a bit more underway: "What is a yogi?"</p>
