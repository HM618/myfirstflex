        <h1 class="header">Love is Not a Concept</h1>
        <h6><i> a poem</i></h6>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">I didn't know it to be this way. I always thought that the way you showed love to someone was by always treating them the best. Always putting on a smile, encouragement, compassion. I thought that the person you love is also the person whom you
          speak most kindly to and about. I thought all of these things, because I had never been in love. I’d loved, but never been in it.</p>

        <p class="lead">Did you know you can hate someone you love? You can. I also didn’t know that. You can hold someone so high up on a pedestal that the moment they disappoint you, or even surprise you, destroy or smear the perfect image you had of him or her, you
          begin to resent them. Hate and love are similar in that way. They start as mere flickers of an idea, then grow into something very, very real, that demand nutrients- thought and attention. Perhaps your resentment grows to hate because your expectations
          seemed so reliable and safe, that it feels almost intentional when this person doesn’t live up to it, or even meet you half-way with this fantasy of who they are. Forget about who they could be. We could all be something other than what we are.
          It’s the who we are that we spend a lifetime unveiling. </p>

        <p class="lead">When you are in love with someone, that’s when the hate becomes hurt. They say behind anger is fear, and beneath fear is pain…</p>


        <p class="lead">I once knew a man who seemed immune to the sort of pain intimate emotions tend to inflict. He lived purely in the moment, moving from experience to experience, without having the burden of some previous event unjustly mingling with the present.
          He was beautiful in this way. His attention was always set to the task at hand or the person in front of him. It was with the ease in which he did this that people naturally gravitated to him, confided in him and trusted him almost immediately.
          And he never let on that his disposition was predisposed to comfort or leisure, because his responses were always clean, concise, to the point without facade, behind all of the bullshit that people tend to decorate their lives in.</p>

        <p class="lead">I suppose they call that charisma. Some might say wisdom. Actually, it was that really he just cared in a way that didn’t draw upon empathy or even compassion. He cared in a way that he saw every exchange with someone as the potential moment for
          that person to change for the better, to become lighter, easier, perhaps happier…</p>



        <p class="lead">Did you know that when you're in love with someone, it is no longer about who they are for you or how they are for you? It’s a reciprocity of everything they are and are becoming, and who you are and are becoming. It is allowing someone to fully
          engage with your growth as an individual without following in exactly the same line? That is much harder than it sounds. </p>

        <p class="lead">Like taking a hike together, starting from the same place and intending to meet at the end, despite wandering off every now and then, only meeting to exchange material goods or knowledge of what you’ve learned along the way. Never the same path,
          together, but the same intention. Sometimes that means sharing something that is ugly, that is unkind or full of grief. When you are in love illness can come because the gifts your someone gives are not always a smile, something warm or something
          kind. Sometimes they are sharp observations about yourself or the world, and then you must give back exactly what stirs within you without censorship. If you change it, you only keep the ugly for yourself. Toss the ugly back and forth between
          yourselves until it no longer has so much weight. The ugly, that starts like a large piece of stone with sharp edges and muscle tearing weight, is thrown back and forth between you, weathering slowly from the touch of your hands, until it begins
          to steadily transform into a smoother, smaller, lighter object, that may no longer be so ugly, but curious. It may stop being so important as to be curious but suddenly informative and light. It may become so permeable and light that it begins
          to float. Like a bubble, it will suspend itself for a moment and then disappear.</p>
